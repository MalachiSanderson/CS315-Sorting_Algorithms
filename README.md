# CS315-Sorting_Algorithms

(https://github.com/MalachiSanderson/CS315-Sorting_Algorithms)

Code I made to get familiar with working with and to test several of the sorting algorithms we covered in CS315 Fall 2022.  
(Most of the core algorithms were taken from the Prof's and the book's author's code).


AS OF 11/1/22 THE CURRENT CODE (SPECIFICALLY THE MAIN) IS BUILT TO EXECUTE
THE TESTS AS DEFINED IN TEST REPORT DOCUMENT UPON COMPILING AND 
RUNNING THE "TestClient.java" FILE. 
The project as whole has many other features inlcuding being able to run it in 
command line by passing it arguments when you call it there as well as just 
being able to run the program and interact with it via a command line menu interface 
(check that out its pretty cool).
To play with these other options just wait for the tests to complete 
(as of 11/1/22 test execute automatically on startup). 
Note that the tests take a good while to finish.
